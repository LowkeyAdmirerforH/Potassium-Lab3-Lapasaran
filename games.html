              <p>Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users. This game is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. Roblox allows players to buy, sell, and create virtual items which can be used to decorate their virtual character that serves as their avatar on the platform.</p>
